/// A control flow task that repeats a sequence a specified number of times.
///
/// The `Repeat` task executes its child sequence multiple times based on the iteration count.
/// If iterations is `.infinite`, it repeats indefinitely. It succeeds after completing all
/// iterations successfully and fails if the sequence fails at any point.
///
/// ## Behavior
///
/// - Executes the sequence repeatedly
/// - Counts down remaining iterations on each success
/// - Fails immediately if the sequence fails
/// - Succeeds when all iterations complete successfully
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// - `.running` if currently executing or between iterations
/// - `.succeeded` if all iterations have completed successfully
/// - `.failed` if the sequence has failed
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Repeat(.count(3)) {
///     Jump()
///     Wait(1.0)
/// }
/// // Jumps 3 times with 1 second between each
/// ```
