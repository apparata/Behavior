/// A decorator task that waits for a duration or tick count before succeeding.
///
/// The `Wait` task delays execution by running for a specified time duration
/// or number of ticks before completing with success.
///
/// ## Behavior
///
/// - Runs for the specified duration (in seconds) or number of ticks
/// - Accumulates time/ticks on each frame
/// - Succeeds when the duration/tick count is reached
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// - `.running` if time or ticks remain
/// - `.succeeded` if the duration or tick count has been reached
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Sequence {
///     Attack()
///     Wait(2.0)          // Wait 2 seconds
///     PlayVictorySound()
/// }
///
/// // Or wait by tick count:
/// Wait(ticks: 60)        // Wait 60 frames
/// ```
