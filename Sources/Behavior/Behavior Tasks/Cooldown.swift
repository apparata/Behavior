import Foundation

/// A decorator task that prevents re-execution for a duration after completion.
///
/// The `Cooldown` task rate-limits its child by enforcing a cooldown period after the child completes.
/// During the cooldown, it returns the cached result without re-executing the child.
///
/// ## Behavior
///
/// - Executes the child task normally
/// - When child completes, starts a cooldown timer
/// - During cooldown, returns the cached result without re-running
/// - After cooldown expires, allows child to execute again
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// - `.running` if the child is currently running
/// - `.succeeded` or `.failed` based on the child's result (cached during cooldown)
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Cooldown(5.0, ExpensiveAbility())  // Can only use ability once per 5 seconds
/// ```
public final class Cooldown<Context>: BuiltInBehaviorTask<Context> {

    /// The cooldown duration after child completes (in seconds).

    /// The child task to rate-limit.
    public let child: BehaviorTask<Context>

    private var cooldownRemaining: TimeInterval = 0
    private var lastResult: BehaviorState?

    /// Creates a cooldown decorator.

    ///   - duration: The cooldown duration in seconds after completion (minimum: 0).
