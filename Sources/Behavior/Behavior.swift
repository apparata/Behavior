/// A behavior tree execution engine that manages the execution of hierarchical task trees.
///
/// The `Behavior` class is the main entry point for creating and running behavior trees.
/// It manages a collection of named trees, executes the root tree, and tracks the overall state.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Behavior trees are hierarchical structures used to model complex decision-making logic,
/// commonly used in game AI. The tree is executed by calling ``tick(time:)`` each frame,
/// which processes the tree from the root down through its children.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let behavior = Behavior(for: gameEntity) {
///     Tree("Root") {
///         Sequence {
///             FindTarget()
///             MoveToTarget()
///             Attack()
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Each frame:
/// let time = BehaviorTime(elapsed: deltaTime, accumulated: totalTime, actual: currentTime)
/// behavior.tick(time: time)
/// ```

    public let iterations: BehaviorIterations
